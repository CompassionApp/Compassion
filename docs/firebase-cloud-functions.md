# Firebase Cloud Functions

Keeping a list here of all the Cloud Functions we'll need to run our application:

### Notifications

_Tasks that require sending push notifications and creating `Notification` documents in the users' inbox._

- Reminder notifications before session start
- Re-send notifications to all available chaperones if request hasn't been responded to in 12(?)h

### Janitorial / Data Upkeep

_Tasks that will keep the system healthy by removing unused & irrelevant data_

- Archive expired/canceled requests
